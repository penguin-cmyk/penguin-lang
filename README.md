# penguin-lang
A language that im making in rust for fun as a project to learn more about parsing

# penguin-lang is going under a heavy rewrite right now
- Since I the first code was really unredeable and also had bad handling of certain statements (in debug) I just decided to rewrite it
  - [x] Lexer (half)
  - [] Parser
  - [] Interpreter
